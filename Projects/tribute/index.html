    <p>A Tribute to my favorite band, Payable on Death, known as P.O.D.</p> They've been making music since 1992 and are from the <i>"619"</i> San Diego, California.</p>
	  <p><b>Literally the best band ever!</b> The genres from soft rock, reggae rock, ska punk, rap rock, rap metal, nu metal and above all they are a Christian Band. Here are the guys from the band:</p>
      <ul>
			  <li>Sonny Sandoval, throat of P.O.D.</li>
			  <li>Wuv Bernardo, drums</li>
			  <li>Marcos Curiel, lead guitar</li>
			  <li>Traa Daniels, bassist</li>
		  </ul>

	  <p>My favorite 3 albums from P.O.D.:</p>
		  <p>
			  <dl>
				  <dt><b>Satellite:</b> 
				  <dd><i>Satellite</i> was released on 09/11/2001. Tremendously grateful for this album, the music helped me and so many people get through really difficult times in America. The album has my #1 lifesong <i>"Alive."</i>
				  <dt><b>Testify:</b>
				  <dd><i>Testify</i> was released on 01/24/2006. Another great album, that was released while I was going through a really bad divorce. I love the reggae rock and the collaboration with <i>"Matisyahu,"</i> and before she became super famous, <i>"Katy Perry."</i> The album describes the band on how they can testify through the music; the strength of having faith and moving forward.
				  <dt><b>Payable on Death:</b>
				  <dd><i>Payable on Death</i> was realsed on 11/04/2003. The album is self-titled, and speaks for itself, <b>Payable on Death</b>. I love this album, a little bit more heavy than the previous albums, and they had a song for the movie <i>"The Matrix"</i> named <i>"Sleeping Awake"</i>pretty cool!
